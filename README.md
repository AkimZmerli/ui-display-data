> *"Great things in business are never done by one person. They're done by a team of people."* - Steve Jobs

A modern, responsive web application for visualizing Facebook advertising insights data, built through collaborative development and community feedback.

## 🚀 Live Demo

*Coming soon - Docker deployment in progress*

## 📖 The Collaboration Story

### The Vision
This project began as an exploration into modern data visualization for marketing analytics. The goal was to create a clean, intuitive dashboard that could transform raw Facebook Ads insights into actionable visual data for marketers and business owners.

### The Partnership
What makes this project special isn't just the technology—it's the collaborative spirit that shaped its development. Working alongside [FriedrichtenHagen](https://github.com/FriedrichtenHagen), this project exemplifies how open-source collaboration can elevate a simple idea into something more robust and user-friendly.

### The Journey
- **December 2024**: Initial development sprint with Next.js 15 and React 19
- **The Breakthrough**: Successfully integrated Facebook Ads API data with a responsive UI
- **The Reality Check**: FriedrichtenHagen's eagle-eyed feedback identified crucial gaps in our documentation and setup process
- **The Learning**: Sometimes the most valuable contributions come from fresh perspectives pointing out what you can't see

### The Growth
Through FriedrichtenHagen's constructive feedback, we learned that great code isn't enough—great documentation and user experience are equally important. Their issue "#1: Missing setup guide to run project locally" became a catalyst for improving the entire developer experience.
